App Creation
Individual Apps
These are apps which are created for your own personal usage. These apps can be used only by the creator of the app and no other client can login and make use of this particular app.
To create an app, you need to follow the following steps:-

Login to API Dashboard
Click on Create App
Provide the following details
App Icon
App Name
Redirect URL
Description (Optional)
App Permissions - Refer Permissions Template

Third Party Apps
These apps are used by platform providers which would allow end users to login to the app and make use of the functionality. These apps are created by third party application providers to enable FYERS clients to use their applications.
To create a common app, you can get in touch with us at api-support@fyers.in.

Redirect URI
The user will be redirected to the redirect uri after successfully logging in using the FYERS credentials. The redirect uri should be in your control as the auth token is sensitive information.

Authentication & Login Flow - User Apps
Authentication Steps
The login flow is as follows:

Navigate to the Login API endpoint
After successful login, user is redirected to the redirect uri with the auth_code
POST the auth_code and appIdHash (SHA-256 of api_id + app_secret) to Validate Authcode API endpoint
Obtain the access_token use that for all the subsequent requests

client_id	string	This is the app_id which you have received after creating the app.
Eg: “qwerty-100”
redirect_uri	string	This is where the user will be redirected after successful login.
Eg: https://trade.fyers.in/api-login/redirect-uri/index.html
This should be the same as what was provided at the time of app creation
response_type	string	This value must always be “code”
state	string	You send a random value. The same value will be returned after successful login to the redirect uri.
Eg: “abcdefg”

Best Practices
These are the recommended best practises that you should follow while using the APIs

Never share your app_secret with anyone
Never share your access_token with anyone
Do not provide trading permissions unless you want to use the app to place orders
Provide a redirect_uri which is in your control rather than a public endpoint such as google.com
You should send a random value in the state parameter and verify whether the same value has been returned to you


Authentication & Login Flow - Third Party Apps
OAuth2 is authentication flow for Third Party Apps

OAuth2 - Auth Flow
This is a simple OAuth 2 Authentication Flows.

This is recommended for applications which have a backend server which can authenticate the second step
This is not recommended for Single Page Applications (SPA)

Order Placement Guide
Order Placement Guide
The order placement process requires you to carefully input several parameters at the time of making the request. There are several validations which are required to be done before sending the request.

Order Types
Limit Order

type: 1
A limit order allows you to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (limitPrice) or better. It will only be executed at the specified price or lower for a buy order, and at the specified price or higher for a sell order.

Sample input:

{ "symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ", "qty": 100, "type": 1, "side": 1, "productType": "INTRADAY", "limitPrice": 100, "stopPrice": 0, "validity": "DAY", "stopLoss": 0, "takeProfit": 0, "offlineOrder": false, "disclosedQty": 0, "isSliceOrder" : false }
Market Order

type: 2
A market order allows you to buy or sell an asset at the current market price. The limitPrice and stopPrice should be set to 0, as it is not used in this order type.

Sample input:

{ "symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ", "qty": 100, "type": 2, "side": 1, "productType": "INTRADAY", "limitPrice": 0, "stopPrice": 0, "validity": "DAY", "stopLoss": 0, "takeProfit": 0, "offlineOrder": false, "disclosedQty": 0, "isSliceOrder" : false }
Stop Order / SL-M

type: 3
A stop order is designed to limit losses on a position. It becomes a market order when the stopPrice is reached. The stopPrice is the trigger price at which the market order will be placed.
The stopPrice must not be higher than the Last Traded Price (ltp) for a sell order and not lower than the ltp for a buy order.

Sample input:

{ "symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ", "qty": 100, "type": 3, "side": 1, "productType": "INTRADAY", "limitPrice": 0, "stopPrice": 100, "validity": "DAY", "stopLoss": 0, "takeProfit": 0, "offlineOrder": false, "disclosedQty": 0, "isSliceOrder" : false }
Stop Limit Order / SL-L

type: 4
A stop-limit order combines features of a stop order and a limit order. It triggers a limit order once the stopPrice is reached.
The stopPrice must not be higher than the Last Traded Price (ltp) for a sell order and not lower than the ltp for a buy order.
The stopPrice must be lower than the limitPrice for a buy order and higher than the limitPrice for a sell order.

Sample input:

{ "symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ", "qty": 100, "type": 4, "side": 1, "productType": "INTRADAY", "limitPrice": 100, "stopPrice": 95, "validity": "DAY", "stopLoss": 0, "takeProfit": 0, "offlineOrder": false, "disclosedQty": 0, "isSliceOrder" : false }
Product Types
Intraday

Used to place orders which will be bought and sold the same day
Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)
CNC

Used to place orders only in stocks which will be carried forward
Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)
Margin

Used to place orders in derivative contracts which will be carried forward
Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)
Cover Order (CO)

stopLoss is a mandatory input
stopLoss price is given in points denominated. (Eg: SBIN LTP = 300. For the above example, for buy CO, if you want to put stop loss as 298 then you have to pass "stopLoss" value as 2 (difference between ltp and your desired stop loss) )
Note:
1. "stopLoss" value can be float but should be multiple of 0.0500.
2. Now let's say if you don't provide stopLoss value as multiple of 0.0500 then you can find this error message {'code': -50, 'message': 'StopLoss not a multiple of tick size 0.0500', 's': 'error'}
The order type can be either market or limit (If the market order, then the stop loss price should not be higher than the ltp in buy and lower than the ltp for sell. If the limit order, then the stop loss price should not be higher than the limit price in buy and lower than the limit for sell)
Validity should be “DAY.”
Disclosed quantity should be 0.
Bracket Order (BO)

stopLoss is a mandatory input
takeProfit is a mandatory input
The stopLoss and takeProfit are denominated in rupees above and below the trade price. (Eg: SBIN LTP = 300. So the user can give a target of Rs. 10 and stop loss or Rs. 5.)
Order type can be either market, limit, stop, or stop limit
Validity should be “DAY.”
Disclosed quantity should be 0
Margin Trading Facility (MTF)

This order type is for placing trades with additional margin.
MTF orders require activation.
Only stocks from the approved MTF list are allowed.
Supported order types: Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit.
Price Validations
For all transaction requests (Order placement / modification), the price input should be in accordance with the exchange provided tick size for the particular symbol.

Tick size is applicable for all price inputs (Limit / stop / stopLoss / target)
Each symbol will have its own tick size
All price inputs have to be in multiples of the tick size
The tick size is available in the symbol master
Quantity Validations
For all transaction requests (Order placement / modification), the quantity input should be in accordance with the exchange provided minimum lot size.

Segment	Minimum Quantity Details
Equities	The quantity will be in multiples of 1
Equity Derivatives	The quantity will be in multiples of the lot size specified by the exchange
Currency Derivatives	The quantity will be in multiples of 1
Commodity Derivatives	The quantity will be in multiples of 1
Order Tag
For all Order placement requests where tags are passed they should meet following requirements.

Ordertag string should be Alphanumeric i.e. no space or special characters will be allowed.
Ordertag string should not exceed length of 30 characters and should have minimum length of 1 character.
Ordertag string cannot be your clientID or string Untagged.
Ordertagging is currently not supported for ProductType BO & CO. Orders with ordertag for CO/BO product Type will be rejeceted.
Auto-Order Slice
Use the auto-slice feature to place large orders that exceed the exchange’s freeze-quantity limits.

Enable it by setting "isSliceOrder": true in the order request. When enabled, the system automatically splits the order into smaller quantities based on the applicable freeze limit. Each slice is submitted as a separate order with its own "Order ID".

Note:

Slicing is only allowed for NSE CM, NFO and BFO.
Maximum slices per request: 10.

Sample input :

{ "symbol": "NSE:BANKNIFTY25NOV58900PE", "qty": 3150, "type": 2, "side": 1, "productType": "MARGIN", "limitPrice": 0, "stopPrice": 0, "disclosedQty": 0, "validity": "DAY", "offlineOrder": false, "stopLoss": 0, "takeProfit": 0, "IsSliceOrder": true }

Postback (Webhooks)
The Postback API sends a POST request with a JSON payload to the registered postback_url of your app when an order's status changes. This enables you to get orders updates reliably, irrespective of when they happen (Pending, Cancel, Rejected, Traded).

1. Create web hooks
To Create Postback, you need to create an App by:

Login to API Dashboard.
Once you have logged into the Dashboard, you will see a block where you need to update your webhook URL, webhook secret, and the webhook preference (Cancel, Rejected, Pending, Traded). Here you can add multiple webhooks by clicking on the "Add webhook" button. Create webhooks
After entering the required details, click on the "Create App" button by accepting the terms and conditions.
2. Active App
After successful creation of the App, you need to activate the App by following the Authentication & Login mechanism. After successfully logging in via the App, you will be able to get the order data over the webhook URL.

3. Response
The JSON payload is posted as a raw HTTP POST body. You will have to read the raw body.

Data Api
History
The historical API provides archived data (up to date) for the symbols. across various exchanges within the given range. A historical record is presented in the form of a candle and the data is available in different resolutions like - minute, 10 minutes, 60 minutes...240 minutes and daily.


To Handle partial Candle

To receive completed candle data, it is important to send a timestamp that comes before the current minute. If you send a timestamp for the current minute, you will receive partial data because the minute is not yet finished. Therefore, it is recommended to always use a "range_to" timestamp of the previous minute to ensure that you receive the completed candle data.

Example:
Current Time(seconds can be 1-59): 12:10:20 PM

Input for history will be:

range_from: 12:08:00 PM
range_to: Current Time - 1 minute = 12:09:20 PM
So you will get 2 candles - 12:08 PM and 12:09 PM candles. This example is for 1-minute candles; for other resolutions, you have to subtract the resolution time from "range_to" to get completed candles only.

Option Chain
The Optionchain API provides important information about options trading, specifically focusing on strike prices, which are predetermined prices at which an option contract can be exercised. This API offers data for both Call (CE) and Put (PE) options, along with values for index, IndiaVIX (Volatility Index) and available expiry dates. When using the API, you can specify the number of strike prices you're interested in. For example, if you request a strike count of 2, the API will return data for:

At-The-Money (ATM) strike: The closest strike price to the current market price.
Out-of-The-Money (OTM) strikes: Strike prices higher than the current market price for Calls (CE) and lower than the current market price for Puts (PE). The API will return data for 2 CE and 2 PE OTM strikes.
In-The-Money (ITM) strikes: Strike prices lower than the current market price for Calls (CE) and higher than the current market price for Puts (PE). The API will return data for 2 CE and 2 PE ITM strikes.

Web Socket
Introduction
The WebSocket provides a robust method for accessing real-time data or order updates seamlessly and with low latency. It enables developers and users to establish a persistent, bidirectional connection with the server, allowing them to receive continuous updates, such as symbol updates, depth updates or orderupdate. To enhance your experience with our WebSocket, here are some helpful tips and best practices

Subscription Limit: You have the flexibility to subscribe up to 5000 data subscriptions simultaneously via WebSocket with latest SDK versions, please refer Change Log. Staying within this limit ensures smooth subscription management without errors.
Single Instance: Keep in mind that you can create only one WebSocket connection instance at a time. This approach ensures stability and prevents issues that might arise from multiple concurrent connections.
Efficient Thread Management: WebSocket operates on a dedicated thread, allowing it to run independently of your main application thread. This design guarantees that your primary tasks can continue without interruptions from WebSocket operations.
Customizable Callback Functions: Tailor your application's behavior using callback functions provided by the WebSocket. These functions empower you to define specific actions for events like data updates or error occurrences.
Auto-Reconnect: Enjoy uninterrupted connectivity by enabling automatic reconnection in case of disconnection. Simply set the reconnect parameter to true during WebSocket initialization, ensuring your application can recover without manual intervention.You can set max reconnection count upto 50.
Logging to File: If you want to log data to a file, you can set the write_to_file parameter to true. This feature allows you to efficiently save received data to a log file for analysis or archival purposes. The write_to_file function will only work without callback functions.
Reconnect Retry: If you want to define dynamic retry count(max 50), you can set the reconnect_retry parameter to int value of number of times you want it to try reconnection.(In case of node fyersdata.autoreconnect(trycount))
Disable Logging(node JS): In case you want to disable logging use disable logging flag to disable logging sample format:
new FyersSocket("token","logpath",true/*flag to enable disable logging*/)

var fyersdata= new FyersSocket("xxxxx-1xx:ey....","logpath",true/*flag to enable disable logging*/)
fyersdata.autoreconnect(6)//will try to reconnect 6 times in case of disconnection
fyersdata.connect()
General Socket (orders)
The WebSocket API for receiving order, position, trade, price alerts, and EDIS updates is a real-time communication protocol designed to provide seamless access to various critical elements of a trading and EDIS system. This API allows traders and developers to establish a persistent, bidirectional connection with the server, enabling them to receive real-time updates on their orders, current positions, executed trades, price alerts, and EDIS status.

The WebSocket API provides a lightweight and efficient "Lite Mode" for receiving only the Last Traded Price (LTP) updates of specific stock symbols. This mode is designed for users who require real-time access to LTP data without the additional overhead of subscribing to other stock data fields. The Lite Mode allows for seamless integration into applications where only the latest stock prices are needed.

Market Data Unsubscribe
To stop receiving real-time data updates for a specific stock symbol or a group of symbols, you can utilize the "unsubscribe" action in the WebSocket API. Sending an "unsubscribe" message will remove the specified symbol(s) from your active subscriptions, and you will no longer receive updates for those symbols. You can check the sample code to know how to unsubscribe to already subscribed symbols.

Advanced Configuration
The WebSocket queue processing interval is an Optional setting that allows you to customize how frequently data in the subscription queue is handled. By default, this interval is set to 1 millisecond, but it can be adjusted to better suit your application's specific needs and performance preferences.

Customizable Interval: You can set the processing interval anywhere between 1ms to 2000ms (2 seconds), giving you flexibility to optimize performance and responsiveness.
Dynamic Adjustment: The interval setting can be changed at any time during an active WebSocket session.
Performance Optimization: Shorter intervals (1-10ms) are ideal for high-frequency trading scenarios that benefit from rapid data processing, while slightly longer intervals (100-500ms) work well for general market data streaming.
Resource Management: You can tune the interval based on how your application handles incoming data, helping to maintain smooth operation across different environments.

Order Websocket Usage Guide
Introduction
The WebSocket API for receiving order, position, trade, price alerts, and EDIS updates is a real-time communication protocol designed to provide seamless access to various critical elements of a trading and EDIS system. This API allows traders and developers to establish a persistent, bidirectional connection with the server, enabling them to receive real-time updates on their orders, current positions, executed trades, price alerts, and EDIS status.
This guide provides instructions on integrating the order WebSocket into any programming language.



Order WebSocket Connection
To connect to order websocket, the below two input params are mandate

Websocket endpoint : wss://socket.fyers.in/trade/v3
Header:
Format: < appId:accessToken >
Sample header format : 7ABXUX38S-100:eyJ0eXAi**********qiTnzd2lGwS17s


Based on the programming language chosen, respective socket connection libraries can be used.
For the reference please find the sample code for socket connection written in Python.
Here, we are making a connection with Fyers order websocket with parameters and callback functions on_message, on_error, on_close, on_open, which are required in the Python socket connection library used and would change as per the other programming library used. Sample callback function is shared below.

Note : Handle accordingly in your Programming language

Connection Response:

On Success: Returns the socket object

On Failure:

Subscribe Method
Once the connection is established, it is required to subscribe for required actions to get the data. To subscribe for different actions, create a message data, which would be the string format for json node.

message = json.dumps( {"T": "SUB_ORD", "SLIST": action_data, "SUB_T": 1} )
Json node Params:

T: Type: String
value: “SUB_ORD” (Fixed)

action_data: Type: List/Array
Value: ['orders', 'trades', 'positions', 'edis', 'pricealerts', 'login'] Note: Based on the list passed in action_data web_socket data will be received

SUB_T: Integer
Value: 1 (value 1 is for subscribing and -1 for unsubscribe)

Convert the json to string and send this message to socket to subscribe for action_data mentioned

Sample Response:

{'code': 1605, 'message': 'Successfully subscribed', 's': 'ok'}
Response from socket on any action triggered

Once the subscribed successfully, for any action triggered, data will be received through socket, if any callback function is defined, would receive on function.

Response would be string, In node we get as array buffer and in python we string, then it parsed to required format. In another programming language you might get in another format you just have to change in string.

Type: string
Value: {"orders":{"client_id":"XP0001","exchange":10,"fy_token":"10100000001628","id":"23121800292158","id_fyers":"df013f50-6925-4e2d-ba0f-0becf1229298","instrument":0,"lot_size":1,"offline_flag":false,"oms_flag":"K:1","ord_source":"W","ord_status":20,"ord_type":2,"ordertag":"2:Untagged","org_ord_status":4,"pan":"LVJPS3998E","precision":2,"price_multiplier":1,"product_type":"CNC","qty":1,"qty_multiplier":1,"qty_remaining":1,"report_type":"New Ack","segment":10,"status_msg":"New Ack","symbol":"NSE:BECTORFOOD-EQ","symbol_desc":"MRS BECTORS FOOD SPE LTD","symbol_exch":"BECTORFOOD", "tick_size":0.05,"time_epoch_oms":1702887690,"time_exch":"NA","time_oms":"18-Dec-2023 13:51:30","tran_side":1,"update_time_epoch_oms":1702887690,"update_time_exch":"01-Jan-1970 05:30:00","validity":"DAY"},"s":"ok"}

Note:

Above response would be in the string format (In Python ) and arraybuffer (In Node). You have to check in which format you are getting data from websocket as it is dependent on the websocket library for the particular language.
Once you get data, you have to change into the string.(if already in string format then no need to change). After that, you have to change this string to JSON. Here you find the following keys as a JSON Key (One of them ) : orders, trades, positions.
Now Based on the Key the data is identified, if key is orders it means it is order update message, if key is trades then this message is for trades updates and same for positions updates.
In an Fyers SDK the socket raw response is parsed to generate data with required keys and remove the unnecessary keys

Parsed Data: {'s': 'ok', 'orders': {'clientId': 'XP03754', 'id': '23121800388066', 'qty': 1, 'remainingQuantity': 1, 'type': 2, 'fyToken': '10100000002705', 'exchange': 10, 'segment': 10, 'symbol': 'NSE:PRAJIND-EQ', 'instrument': 0, 'offlineOrder': False, 'orderDateTime': '18-Dec-2023 16:33:24', 'orderValidity': 'DAY', 'productType': 'CNC', 'side': 1, 'status': 4, 'source': 'W', 'ex_sym': 'PRAJIND', 'description': 'PRAJ INDUSTRIES LTD', 'orderNumStatus': '23121800388066:4'}}

All the keys information for orders updates are available there : Link
All the keys information for Trades updates are available there : Link
All the keys information for positions updates are available there : Link

Tick-by-Tick (TBT) Websocket Usage Guide
Introduction
Tick-by-tick data is the most detailed market data, recording every trade and order book update in real-time. Each "tick" includes the price, volume, and timestamp of individual trades, as well as changes to buy and sell orders. This granular data is crucial for analyzing market microstructure, tracking order flow, and developing high-frequency trading strategies.


Key Points:

Available for NFO and NSE Instruments Only
Tick-by-tick data is exclusively available only for NFO (NSE Futures & Options) and NSE (Equity) instruments.
Data Formats
Requests are sent in JSON format.
Responses are received in protobuf format (a compact, efficient data format).
Incremental Data Updates
Instead of sending the full market data repeatedly, the server only sends changes (differences) between the last data packet and the current one.
To get the complete picture, users must maintain previous data and apply these changes.
The official SDKs provided by Fyers will handle this process automatically.
Snapshot Data on New Subscriptions
When a user subscribes to tick-by-tick data, the first packet received is a snapshot, containing the full market data at that moment.
After this, all subsequent packets only contain updates (differences) that need to be applied to the snapshot for a real-time view.

Concept of channels
With the Tick-by-Tick (TBT) WebSocket, we are introducing the concept of channels. A channel acts as a logical grouping for different subscribed symbols, making it easier to manage data streams efficiently.

How Channels Work
When subscribing to market data, you need to specify both the symbols and a channel number.
Simply subscribing to a channel does not start the data stream—you must also resume the channel to begin receiving updates.
Example Usage
Let’s say you organize your subscriptions as follows:
Channel 1: All Nifty-related symbols
Channel 2: All BankNifty-related symbols
Now, depending on what data you need, you can control the channels dynamically:
To receive only Nifty data → Pause Channel 2 and Resume Channel 1
To receive only BankNifty data → Pause Channel 1 and Resume Channel 2
To receive both Nifty and BankNifty data → Resume both channels
This approach provides greater flexibility and control over market data streaming, allowing you to filter and manage real-time data efficiently.

Response Message Types
We use Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the response format for all market data. The .proto file, which defines the data structure, is available at:

📌 Proto URL: https://public.fyers.in/tbtproto/1.0.0/msg.proto

Protobuf is a widely used data format, and compilers are available to generate code in different programming languages.

How to Install and Use Protobuf

Protobuf Compiler Installation: https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/
Using Protobuf with Python: https://protobuf.dev/reference/python/python-generated/
Using Protobuf with Node.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs
We have uploaded the compiled files also for python, nodejs, and golang. You can download the files from the below link: https://public.fyers.in/tbtproto/1.0.0/protogencode.zip
